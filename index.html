                    <p><strong class="co-name">Classic Cleaning by Moms, Inc.</strong> was started by two moms in 2000. We wanted a more flexible schedule in order to spend more time with our kids. By working during school hours, we were able to be there to pick up our kids from school and after school activities. Soon supper, homework, and bedtime became less stressful and more rewarding.</p>
                    <p>From the very first day, cleaning our customer’s homes with the same care as we clean our own homes was first priority. We became quite popular because we were doing the job right! Customers appreciated the quality of our work! Housework traditionally has been underappreciated but we find great pride in a job well-done.</p>
                    <p> Most of our cleaners are moms. Their family needs are varied. A few only work during school hours, some can work longer hours during the summer, and others are full-time all year round.</p>
                    <p> As moms, our kids are our highest priority! After nine years we have been, and will continue to be, sensitive to our Cleaning Moms’ needs for their children. We offer them the flexibility they require. Happier workers make the best cleaners and help us to maintain “quality detailed cleaning.”</p>

                                    Of course this is a basic cleaning guideline, yet every customer may have different needs. Customers are encouraged to make a check list of special requests or extra attention to certain areas. A priority list is helpful to those with a limited budget. Please consider extra time for refrigerator &amp; oven cleanings during a regular cleaning.

                        <p>I know the women who own and operate Classic Cleaning by Moms, so I trust this company in my home. They are honest and dependable people who see their customers as ‘real’ people and work hard to meet their very personal needs. Before an important date or event, I can always call and they’ll work me into the schedule. They remember me and my home and know my likes and dislikes – what I value as important – and they always fulfill my expectations. The cleaners are always meticulous, down to the last detail in every room. Always putting things where they belong and taking care of delicate items appropriately, they are conscientious with my things and respect my privacy. I have used other cleaning services in the past, and now that I know Classic Cleaning by Moms I wouldn’t have anyone else in my home – and I wouldn’t recommend another service!</p>

                        <p>I have used Classic Cleaning by Moms for a couple of years now and really appreciate their services. The employees are hard working and thorough. I don’t have to watch them; in fact, my husband and I have left our house to run errands while they were there and have never worried about leaving them alone. I don’t know how I got along without them.</p>

                        <p>I have been a customer of Classic Cleaning by Moms, Inc. since January 2001. I had never used a cleaning service before that time, and my two greatest concerns were finding someone who would provide quality cleaning and also finding someone who I could trust in my home. Classic Cleaning quickly dismissed both of my concerns and exceeded my expectations. The owners are very conscientious about the quality of work and the quality of the employees that they hire. They have been willing to work with my schedule for cleanings when I had out-of-town guests, parties, or travel. We have established a relationship where I feel confident that my cleaning needs will be met (if at all possible), even on short notice. If someone needs a little help or a lot of help, they are willing to customize the cleaning to the customer’s desires, and that is also an important attribute when considering a cleaning service.</p>
