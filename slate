I don’t know how I got along without them.</p>

I had never used a cleaning service before that time, and my two greatest concerns were finding someone who would provide quality cleaning and also finding someone who I could trust in my home. Classic Cleaning quickly dismissed both of my concerns and exceeded my expectations. The owners are very conscientious about the quality of work and the quality of the employees that they hire. They have been willing to work with my schedule for cleanings when I had out-of-town guests, parties, or travel. We have established a relationship where I feel confident that my cleaning needs will be met (if at all possible), even on short notice. If someone needs a little help or a lot of help, they are willing to customize the cleaning to the customer’s desires, and that is also an important attribute when considering a cleaning service.</p>

They are honest and dependable people who see their customers as ‘real’ people and work hard to meet their very personal needs.  Before an important date or event, I can always call and they’ll work me into the schedule.  They remember me and my home and know my likes and dislikes – what I value as important – and they always fulfill my expectations.  The cleaners are always meticulous, down to the last detail in every room.  Always putting things where they belong and taking care of delicate items appropriately, they are conscientious with my things and respect my privacy.  I have used other cleaning services in the past, and now that I know Classic Cleaning by Moms I wouldn’t have anyone else in my home – and I wouldn’t recommend another service!</p>
